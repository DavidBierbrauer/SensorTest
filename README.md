HaiveEye:

A test script to test the ballpark of accuracy for interaction sensors, based on a simple setup of a high accuracy ball screw, NEMA23 with encoder controlled by an arduino with a simple stepper firmware, a high accuracy linear gauge for precise reference and a sensor (light, laser, hall etc...) that needs to be evaluated. Details of the code can be found as comments within the code.
